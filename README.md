# Animal-Population-Comparisons

* Python

* Uses Matplotlib library to create graphs to see how various populations of animal species are correlated with each other (lions and wildebeest, etc.)

* Relationships examined include predator-prey, invasive and native species, and species in similar niches

* Uses Scipy to calculate the Spearman's rho correlation coefficient between the two animal populations
